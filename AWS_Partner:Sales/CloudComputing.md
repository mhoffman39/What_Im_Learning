# Why Customers Choose AWS

Customer obsession - putting customers first

1. Trade upfront investment for pay-as-you-go model
1. Increase speed and agility
1. Streamline and enhance infrastructure decisions
1. Increase margins
1. Scale globally
1. Improve security
1. Increase innovations
1. Accelerate time to business value

## What are customers building

1. Backup and restore - Many customers start simple, with a "storage only" migration. They look for workloads that do not imminently require an application migration, and start their cloud journey by just moving data. Backup and restore is usually a straightforward place to start because it is relatively non-disruptive to existing IT processes, and practically every major backup software vendor integrates directly with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). 

1. Archive and compliance - Customers with large data archives for long-term retention or for regulatory compliance are also quickly moving to AWS because they know how unreliable and costly their on-premises tape infrastructure is. By moving that data to AWS, they can save a lot of money and make sure that their data is there when they need it because of constant data validation and fixity checking performed with AWS.

1. Home directories - Home directories are another storage-only move that can provide significant storage cost savings, with minimal disruption to existing processes. Managing file servers and network-attached storage (NAS) systems that serve home directories can result in administrative overhead and complexity. Amazon FSx provides a fully managed native Windows file system that customers can use to share their user home directories to end users.

1. Data lakes - Data is only as valuable as the insights that your customers can derive from it. With data lakes, they can use native AWS and partner services to run big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), ML, HPC, and media processing to gain insight from unstructured data sets. A data lake can serve as a central repository of data, regardless of source or format. With a data lake, customers can eliminate data silos, which inherently can obscure data and limit the value of their data.

1. Modern applications - With AWS and its partners, you can decide how to migrate your applications and at what pace. For example, you could opt for a more conservative migration, with little to no change to your application, referred to re-hosting or lift and shift. Or, you could pick a much more transformative move to the cloud to unleash all its potential. This is referred to as refactoring or rearchitecting. The more you modernize with AWS, the more you can reduce costs, gain efficiencies, retire technical debt, improve agility with automation, and free up resources for innovation.

1. Business-critical applications - One of the most common sets of workloads that customers want to bring to AWS is their business-critical applications. Examples include enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions, databases, and the content management systems (CMS) for their websites. And often, they simply want to lift and shift those applications into the cloud without making major changes right away. AWS provides several services to make these lift-and-shift migrations possible while also helping customers save money in the process.

# Cloud Business Value

## Business Value and Benchmarking

Business value - helps determine the long-term health and well-being of a business including but not limited to its economic value (reduced costs, reduced down-time, improved decision-making, etc.)

### AWS Cloud Value Framework 
Cloud Value Framework - a conceptual structure intended to build a comprehensive business case for cloud adoption and helps articulate the value of adopting the cloud

### Value Benchmarking
Value benchmarking - helps inform customers about what their peers are doing in an objective, data-driven way

## AWS Cloud Value Framework: Cost Saving

### Cost Savings

1. Maintaining or reducing total AWS spend, regardless of usage
1. Allowing costs to rise in response to increased demand

Organizations see costs savings as decreases in IT spend and infrastructure spend. Cost reductions can continue as customers migrate to additional AWS cloud services

## AWS Cloud Value Framework: Staff Productivity

Staff productivity is realized through efficiency improvement by function on a task-by-task basis. It is all about making your staff more productive by reducing or eliminating time spent on tasks no longer needed in the cloud. 

### Example
The tasks a server administrator might be performing with on-premises hardware. When moved to AWS, tasks such as hardware repair and server planning might be reduced or eliminated altogether, freeing up capacity for staff to focus on more strategic work. In this example, we’re looking at a subset of tasks that a server administrator would be performing. A server administrators responsibilities will vary by organization. Along with the tasks, we indicate the typical reduction in time spent on the task, based on what other AWS customers have achieved.

## AWS Cloud Value Framework: Operational Resilience
The business value that the cloud generates in the form of resiliency includes increased system availability, reduced latency, higher SLA achievement, and better security. 

## AWS Cloud Value Framework: Business Agility
Agility refers to the ability to respond quickly and effectively to changes in business conditions or disruptive business events. Winning in a digitally competitive industry or market depends heavily on agility in product development.

# Cloud Objection Handling

## Cloud Objections
Understanding your customer's underlying challenges and concerns is critical to providing them with the appropriate solution.

## Cost
### Ways you can optimize to save customers money
1. Choose the right pricing models
1. Match capacity with demand
1. Implement processes to identify resource waste

## Security, Compliance, and Privacy

1. AWS has over 500 security, compliance,and governance services and featuers
1. AWS supports 98 security standards and compliance certifications
1. All 117 AWS services that store customer data offer the ability to encrypt that data

### Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (CLOUD)
- Provides a limited mechanism for US law enforcement to request data
- Creates additional safeguards for cloud content
- Does not affect AWS services or how we operate our business

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- A European privacy law
- Harmonizes data protection laws throughout the EU
- Applies to all organizations established in the EU and to any organization that processes personal dat of EU individuals

### Shared Responsibility Model
**Shared Responsibility Model** - AWS is responsible for security OF the cloud. Customers are responsible for security IN the cloud.

## Loss of Control or Visibility
Cloud customers have more visibility and control than ever through centralized monitoring and governance tools such as AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Security Hub, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Config, and AWS Organizations. Every server can have up to 50 labels attached to it. These can then feed centralized dashboards for visualization and control. For example, now every developer can directly see how their design decisions affect invoicing.

## Existing Infrastructure
Most AWS customers run hybrid infrastructures, meaning that some of it is in more traditional on-premises data centers and other parts are in the cloud. Moving to AWS does not mean an all-or-nothing move and getting rid of your customer’s present investment. It is about optimizing and streamlining their infrastructure, meaning they move to the cloud only what makes sense.

## Skills Gap
- Reduce the gap by selecting a migration strategy within the comfort zone and capabilities of the organization. Migrating isn’t a synonym of modernizing. Customers can pick more familiar cloud options.
- Bridge the gap internally by upskilling staff.
- Bridge the gap externally. AWS Partners can assist in bridging the gap while customer upskills their staff. Customers can also delegate operational heavy lifting to partners or to AWS Managed Services (AMS), so that their staff can focus on business-related, value-added tasks.

## Vendor Lock-in
The term "lock-in" is misleading. We should really talk about switching costs. Switching costs has existed throughout IT history.

## Sustainability
In 2019, AWS commissioned a report on carbon emissions of the cloud in comparison to typical enterprise data centers. It found that AWS is significantly more energy efficient and has a significantly smaller carbon footprint, than most US data centers.

The AWS infrastructure is 3.6 times more energy efficient than the median of the surveyed US enterprise data centers. And AWS performs the same tasks with an 88 percent lower carbon footprint.
